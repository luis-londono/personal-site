        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my page! My name's Luis and I'm a software developer.
        I"ve been professionaly writing code since 2015 and absolutely love what I do!
        <p />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after graduating from the University of Missouri-Kansas City, I found a really great job at <a id="neu" href="https://www.neuanalytics.com"> NeuAnalytics</a>
        where I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing mentors and advance my career in the Fintech industry. I'm excited for the future and I try and push myself to become a better developer each day.
        <p />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love spending my time with family, hanging out with my friends, traveling the and supporting local Kansas City sports teams.
        <p />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for visiting my page!
