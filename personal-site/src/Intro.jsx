            My name's Luis and I'm a software developer. I've been professionaly
            writing
            <code id="code"> &lt;code/&gt; </code>
            since 2015 and absolutely love what I do!
            <p />
            Shortly after graduating from the University of Missouri-Kansas
            City, I found a really great job at

            I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing mentors and
            advance my career in the Fintech industry. I'm excited for the
            future and I try and push myself to become a better developer each
            day.

            I love spending my time with family, hanging out with my friends,
            traveling the and supporting local Kansas City sports teams.
